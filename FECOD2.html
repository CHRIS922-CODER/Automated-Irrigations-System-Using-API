		<h1 style="color: blue">ABOUT </h1>
		<h2 style="color: powderblue; text-align: left;">We are learning web development using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. </h2>
		<p >We are a foundation dedicated to equiping people with different Web Development skills </p>
		<p>Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual construction and programming of websites and apps; we major on website development.

			Think of all the websites you have used over the years – Web Developers built those sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on.</p>
		<p>You will learn about the different numbers of html elements using tags and how they can be used in development of the responsive website . <br> For CSS after a successful study and well passed assessement you will be able to style your website in accordance with how you want the website to appear   </p> 
		<p>We offer all the courses free of charge  and for the advanced courses at an affordable price.</p>
		<p>After completion of the course, we give a certificate of merit to our learners.</p>
		<p>What we major in is Front End Development</p>
		<p>Front-end development involves the “client-facing” side of web development. That is to say that it generally refers to the portion of the site, app, or digital product that users will see and interact with. A Front-End Developer, therefore, is responsible for the way a digital product looks and “feels,” which is why they are often also referred to as Web Designers.

			Front-End Developers will usually need to possess a solid understanding of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React, Bootstrap, Backbone, AngularJS, and EmberJS.</p>
			<p>Then this question always arises:What Are Jobs in Front-End Development? <br> Unlike back-end development, there are a number of job titles that cover different skill sets and experience levels within front-end development, including:</p>
			<ul>
				Front-End Developer
<li>Front-End Engineer</li>
